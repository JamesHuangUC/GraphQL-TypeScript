# GraphQL TypeScript React App


## Description

I started this project because I can't find many online resources about how to build a full stack GraphQL application. This application supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and it's type-safe, thanks to TypeScript. Also, this application can be a GraphQL starter project for building large full stack applications.

Check out this application on [Heroku](https://graphql-typescript.herokuapp.com).
